# TWD Plugin for Claude Code

Deterministic in-browser testing plugin for Claude Code. Writes, runs, and fixes component-level browser tests for SPAs using [TWD (Test While Developing)](https://github.com/BRIKEV/twd).

TWD tests run inside the app's own dev server — no separate browser process. This makes them **complementary to E2E tools like Playwright or Cypress**, not a replacement. Use TWD for fast, deterministic component and page-level tests during development; use Playwright/Cypress for full end-to-end flows across multiple pages, real network requests, and cross-browser validation.

## Installation

Add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add BRIKEV/twd-ai
claude plugin install twd@twd-ai
```

## What's Included

### `/twd:setup` Command

Interactive setup that detects your project configuration and generates `.claude/twd-patterns.md` — a project-specific config file the TWD agent reads for every test run.

```
/twd:setup
```

What it does:
- Auto-detects framework, Vite config, entry point, CSS libraries
- Asks about auth middleware, third-party modules, API folder structure
- Generates `.claude/twd-patterns.md` with project-specific patterns
- Optionally installs TWD packages and configures your project

### `/twd:ci-setup` Command

Sets up CI/CD for TWD tests — installs `twd-cli`, optionally configures code coverage, and generates a GitHub Actions workflow.

```
/twd:ci-setup
```

What it does:
- Detects your project setup (framework, Vite config, existing workflows)
- Installs `twd-cli` for headless test running
- Optionally sets up code coverage with `vite-plugin-istanbul` + `nyc` (requires Vite)
- Generates `.github/workflows/twd-tests.yml`

### `twd` Skill

Autonomous testing agent that writes, runs, and fixes in-browser tests. Invoked by the model when you ask for testing work.

Examples:
- "Write tests for the login page"
- "Run all TWD tests and fix any failures"
- "Set up TWD and test the dashboard"

The agent follows a 5-phase workflow:
1. **Detect** — checks project state and reads `.claude/twd-patterns.md`
2. **Setup** — installs TWD if needed (packages, service worker, entry point)
3. **Write** — analyzes your app and writes flow-based tests
4. **Run & Fix** — runs tests via twd-relay, isolates failures with `it.only()`, fixes them
5. **Report** — summarizes coverage and results

### `/twd:test-flow-gallery` Command

Reads TWD test files and generates visual Mermaid flowcharts with plain-language summaries — living documentation auto-generated from real tests.

```
/twd:test-flow-gallery
```

What it does:
- Reads all `*.twd.test.{ts,js}` files in the project
- Generates a `.flows.md` file next to each test file with Mermaid diagrams
- Creates a `test-flow-gallery.md` index at the project root
- Each `it()` block gets a plain-language summary + color-coded flowchart

Example output per test:

```
## Items Page

**What this tests:** A user navigates to the items page and sees a list of
all available items. The page loads data from the API and displays each item
as a list entry.
```

Followed by a Mermaid flowchart showing the user flow (purple visit nodes, blue actions, green assertions) and API layer (orange request/response subgraphs).

### `/twd:test-gaps` Command

Scans project routes and cross-references against TWD test files to find untested pages, classify risk, and generate a prioritized gap report.

```
/twd:test-gaps
```

What it does:
- Detects your framework and reads the route config (React Router, Vue Router, Angular, Next.js, Nuxt, SolidJS)
- Discovers all TWD test files and extracts tested routes
- Identifies UNTESTED and PARTIALLY TESTED pages
- Classifies risk: HIGH (mutations, payments), MEDIUM (auth, complex loading), LOW (static, read-only)
- Outputs a prioritized "Start Here" top-5 list

Example output:

```
## Summary
- Pages/routes discovered: 22
- Pages with tests: 15
- Pages partially tested: 2
- Pages untested: 5

## UNTESTED Pages — HIGH Risk
| Page        | Path              | Why High Risk                    |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Checkout    | /checkout         | Handles payments — direct impact |
| User Settings | /settings/account | Has delete account flow         |
```

If no TWD tests are found, the skill detects other test frameworks (Playwright, Jest, etc.) and explains how TWD complements them.

### `/twd:test-quality` Command

Reads TWD test files, evaluates quality across four dimensions, assigns letter grades (A/B/C/D), and generates an improvement report.

```
/twd:test-quality
```

What it does:
- Grades each test file across 4 dimensions:
  - **Journey Coverage** (35%) — complete user flows vs visibility-only checks
  - **Interaction Depth** (20%) — variety of `userEvent` types (click, type, keyboard, etc.)
  - **Assertion Quality** (25%) — `be.visible` (weak) to `deep.equal` on API payloads (strong)
  - **Error & Edge Cases** (20%) — error states, empty states, cancel flows
- Assigns a final letter grade per file and an overall project grade
- Generates specific grade-up suggestions per file
- Ranks improvements by impact

Example output:

```
# TWD Test Quality Report
Files analyzed: 8
Overall grade: C

## Grade Distribution
| Grade | Count | Files                                    |
|-------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| A     | 2     | user-list.twd.test.ts, order-list.twd.test.ts |
| D     | 2     | payment-list.twd.test.ts, item-create.twd.test.ts |

### payment-list.twd.test.ts — Grade D
| Dimension        | Grade | Notes                              |
|------------------|-------|------------------------------------|
| Journey Coverage | D     | 1 test, visibility check only      |
| Interaction Depth| D     | No userEvent calls                 |
| Assertion Quality| D     | Only be.visible and greaterThan(1) |
| Error & Edge Cases| D    | Only happy path                    |

**To reach grade C:** Add a search test with userEvent.type + URL assertion.
Add column header assertions with have.text.
```

Works best alongside `/twd:test-gaps` — gaps tells you **what's untested**, quality tells you **if existing tests are any good**.

## Supported Frameworks

- React
- Vue
- Angular
- Solid.js

Requires Vite as the build tool. Not compatible with SSR-first architectures (Next.js App Router).

## Packages Used

| Package | Purpose | Scope |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `twd-js` | Core testing library | dependency |
| `twd-relay` | CLI test runner via WebSocket | devDependency |
| `twd-cli` | Headless/CI test runner | devDependency (optional) |
| `vite-plugin-istanbul` | Code coverage instrumentation | devDependency (optional) |
| `nyc` | Coverage reporting (text, html, lcov) | devDependency (optional) |

All packages are published by [BRIKEV](https://www.npmjs.com/~brikev) under MIT license. TWD code is guarded by `import.meta.env.DEV` — never included in production builds. `twd-relay` operates exclusively on localhost.

## Project Config: `.claude/twd-patterns.md`

Generated by `/twd:setup`, this file contains:
- Framework and Vite configuration
- Relay commands with correct port/base path
- Standard imports and beforeEach template
- Visit path prefixes
- API service folder location
- Auth middleware and permission mapping
- Third-party modules (what to Sinon-stub in tests)
- CSS/component library references

The `twd` agent reads this file at the start of every run to use project-specific values.

## Updating the Plugin
